                    The QuickQuote is a mobile rating application that I developed while working for MedMal Direct. 
                    The idea is for our sales people to be able to produce quotes for low risk business, and have those quote forms 
                    emailed to their work email, all from their mobile device. It was created with React Native in the front end, and Node.js in the back end.
                    I also used many additional API's and packages, here is the full list:

                    The app is modeled with children and grandchildren components, and the grandchildren lift up the state using 
                    callbacks all the way back out to the parent component. The IndivDocs and IndivAllieds componenents are used to add 
                    entry fields to the form for each insured. They are reusable componenets and can be used a maximum of 3 times each. 
                    The children components, Doctors and Allieds, map and render an array based on a prop passed down from the parent, 
                    which determines the number of grandchildren components to render.

                    When the app is launched, it takes the user to a login screen. If you look closely, you will notice there is 
                    no 'register' link. I created this by design, so the company has full control over who is able to access and use 
                    the app. Once the Login Screen is loaded, a few very important things have happened. The Node.js backend has established a connection with 
                    the MongoDB server, and has imported the relativity tables that are used for the premium calculations. These tables will 
                    be stored in the backend for now. When the user enters his/her login information, the password is hashed and salted with 
                    Bcrypt, and the hash is matched to a document contained in MongoDB. If a match is found, a token is sent back and the main 
                    screen is rendered.

                    This is the main screen. Once the component mounts, a componentDidMount lifecycle method creates a get request to the backend, 
                    and retrieves all the relativity tables that were imported from MongoDB. These tables are then stored in the components' state, 
                    and will be passed down to the children and grandchildren components for premium calculations. This app is basically a dynamic form 
                    that changes and expands as the user makes selections from the dropdown.

                    to the bottom of the form. The user is then able to fill in information about that physician which is needed to calculate 
                    the premium.

                    of 0 will show. The sum of all the physician's premium is calculated instantly as well. I designed this form this way so there 
                    is virtually no possibility of the user making an error.
